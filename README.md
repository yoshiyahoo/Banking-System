## Banking-System
This is a project for our Database Architecture class involving a banking system with a MySQL database connected. 

We will develop a web application program that combines SQL statements and a host language, which a GUI will automatically execute. We develop a basic web app functionality sending queries to the DBMS and showing the results on the website.

The main functionalities allow users to send queries to a DBMS and view the results directly on the website. By using MySQL and Node.js, we establish a server to database connection, where the server is able to gather specific data from the database, then can be formatted and presented to the frontend. With the use of Yaak, an open-source api, we conducted debugging and unit testing from the Node.js server to the DBMS, which allows us to optimize queries for data gathering.

Our application is designed with a focus on personal finance management. It allows users to track their financial history, access detailed account information, and manage customer profiles. Key features include viewing transaction histories on all accounts, creating new customer accounts, and modifying existing profiles - allowing for user-friendly solutions for financial oversight.
